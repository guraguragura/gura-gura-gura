# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the Gura e-commerce platform.

## Authentication & Authorization

### Supabase Auth Integration
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Email/password with optional social login
- **Session Management**: Secure JWT tokens with automatic refresh
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with leaked password protection
- **Account Verification**: Email confirmation flow

### Row-Level Security (RLS)
All database tables implement RLS policies:
- Users can only access their own data
- Admin roles have elevated permissions
- Driver-specific access controls
- Order visibility based on customer/driver relationship

## Input Validation & Sanitization

### Frontend Validation
- Zod schema validation for all forms
- XSS prevention through input sanitization
- CSRF protection via SameSite cookies
- File upload restrictions and validation

### Backend Validation
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- Input length validation
- Email format validation
- Rate limiting on API endpoints

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- HTTPS-only communication
- Database encryption at rest
- JWT token encryption
- Sensitive data hashing

### Privacy Controls
- GDPR compliance features
- Data retention policies
- User data export capabilities
- Account deletion workflows

## Security Headers

Implemented security headers:
```typescript
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), camera=(), microphone=()
```

## API Security

### Rate Limiting
- Authentication endpoints: 5 requests/minute
- Search endpoints: 100 requests/minute
- General API: 1000 requests/hour
- Progressive backoff for violations

### Access Control
- JWT token validation
- Role-based permissions
- API endpoint protection
- Request logging and monitoring

## Monitoring & Incident Response

### Security Monitoring
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual access patterns
- Data export activities
- Admin privilege escalations

### Error Handling
- No sensitive data in error messages
- Structured error logging
- Security event alerting
- Incident response procedures

## Database Security

### Access Controls
- Database user segregation
- Minimum privilege principle
- Regular permission audits
- Secure connection requirements

### Audit Logging
- All data modifications logged
- User activity tracking
- Administrative action logging
- Compliance reporting capabilities

## Vulnerability Management

### Regular Security Assessments
- Automated dependency scanning
- OWASP ZAP security testing
- Penetration testing schedule
- Code security reviews

### Update Procedures
- Security patch management
- Dependency vulnerability monitoring
- Emergency update protocols
- Security advisory subscriptions

## Compliance

### Standards Adherence
- OWASP Top 10 protection
- PCI DSS compliance for payments
- GDPR data protection
- SOC 2 Type II controls

### Documentation
- Security policy documentation
- Incident response procedures
- Data handling guidelines
- User privacy policies
